The increased access to the internet coupled with the ubiquitousness of smartphones has led to a rabid usage of social applications such as social media platforms and chat applications. These applications bestow its users with the ability to share unsolicited pornographic content which its consumers may find offensive or disturbing. In recognition of this, the report attempts to exploit deep learning to demonstrate how a possible solution to this problem may be deployed. In order to do this, a chat application that is capable of identifying and masking pornographic images is developed. In doing so, various prominent deep learning models namely Inception v3, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 are retrained using a pornographic dataset by the application of transfer learning to classify pornographic and non-pornographic content. These models are then evaluated using different model deployment paradigms (on-device and cloud-hosted). The results of the evaluation along with pertinent literature are then used as a basis to make vital architectural decisions in relation to the development of the aforementioned chat application. The cloud-hosted Inception v3 was deemed the most ideal among the explored model and deployment paradigm combinations.
